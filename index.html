            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Whale</a> (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>) is the largest animal that exists on Earth. These magnificent marine mammals belong to the baleen whale suborder and is identified by their big size, bodies, and  blue-gray coloration.</p>
            
            <p>Blue whales are found in oceans around the world, majorily in deep offshore water. They are very famous for their size, with adult individuals reaching length of up to 100 feet (30 meters) and weighing as much as 200 tons. Despite their big size, blue whales are very good swimmers who are capable of reaching speeds of up to 30 miles per hour (48 kilometers per hour).</p>
            
            <p>One of the most amazing features of blue whales are their method of feeding. These mammals are filter feeders, using baleen plates that is present their mouths to hold a large quantity of water for small crustaceans known as krill. A single adult blue whale is able to consume up to 4 tons of krill per day during feeding season.</p>
            
            <p>Blue whales are believed to have been evolved from terrestrial mammals that came to the sea millions of years ago. They are known for their sounds, which can travel for long distances underwater and are supposed to play a role in communication and navigation. These haunting calls, often referred to as "songs," are produced by male bodies during the breeding season and are thought to attract females.</p>
            
            <p>While blue whales are typically solitary creatures, they sometimes form loose associations with other individuals, particularly during feeding or breeding seasons. Despite their solitary nature, blue whales are known to be highly social animals, engaging in playful behaviors such as breaching, tail-slapping, and spy-hopping.</p>
            
            <p>Blue whales also play a vital role in marine ecosystems, helping to regulate the populations of krill and other small marine organisms. Despite their immense size and strength, blue whales is vulnerable to threats such as habitat loss, pollution, and collisions with ships. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these iconic creatures and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>

        <section id="habitat">
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>Blue whales are magnificent marine mammals that inhabit all the world's oceans, ranging from polar to tropical waters. These massive creatures prefer to live in deep offshore waters, where their primary prey, krill, is in vast amount. Blue whales are highly migratory animals, known to undertake long-distance journey spanning thousands of miles each year.</p>
            
            <p>During the summer month, blue whales are commonly found in the cooler, nutrient-rich waters of polar regions, including the Arctic and Antarctic. These area provide ideal feeding grounds for blue whales, as the cold waters support large populations of krill, their main source of food. Blue whales are often observe in areas where upwelling occurs, bringing nutrient-rich waters to the surface and attracting krill.</p><br><br>

            <p>As the seasons change, blue whales does extesive migrations, often traveling to warmer waters for breeding and calving. They may migrate towards the equator or to more temperate regions, depending on their population and environmental conditions. During migration, blue whales travel by following established routes that have been passed down through generations.</p>
            
            <p>While blue whales typically inhabit deep oceanic waters, they may also be found in coastal areas and near continental shelves, particularly during migration. In some regions, such as the California coast and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, blue whales may venture closer to shore in search of food, providing opportunities for whale watching and research.</p>
            
            <p>The habitat of blue whales is characterized by vast expanses of open ocean, where they can roam freely and feed on krill. These marine giants are adapted to life in the open sea, with streamlined bodies and powerfull tails that enable them to travel long distances with minimal effort. Blue whales are capable of diving to incredible depths, often exceeding 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) in search of prey.</p>
            
            <p>Despite their remarkable adaptability, blue whales face numerous threats to their habitat, including pollution, climate change, and noise pollution from shipping and industrial activities. Conservation eforts are underway to protect critical habitats and ensure the long-term survival of these magnificent creatures.</p>

            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) shows a range of behaviors that shows their intelligence, social interactions, and adaptability to the marine environment. While much of their behavior remains a mystery due to the challeges of studying these elusive creatures in their natural habitat, researchers have discovers may intriguing aspects of blue whale behavior.</p>
            
            <p>One of the most iconic behaviorss of blue whales is breaching, where they get themselves out of the water and crash back down with hugre force. Breaching is believed to serve various purposes, including communication, play, and parasite removal. The sight of a massive blue whale launching itself into the air is a breathtaking spectacle.</p>
            
            <p>Blue whales are also know as  their haunting vocalizations, which can travel for long distances underwater. These low-frequency sounds, often referred  as "songs," are produced by males during the breeding season and are tink to attract females and establish dominance among males. Each blue whale population has its own unique vocal , allowing individuals to recognize one another and communicate over vast distances.</p>
            
            <p>While blue whales are typically solitary creatures, they may forms loose associations with other individuals, particularly during feedings or breeding seasons. This associations are often temporary and may consist of small groups of whales congregating in areas with abundant food or suitable breeding grounds.</p>
            
            <p>Blue whales are also known to involved in a variety of surface behaviors, including tail-slaping, flippering, and spy-hopping. These behaviors serve multiple functions, such as communication, navigation, and play. Tail-slapping, for example, is be used to stun prey or communicate with other whales, while spy-hopping allows whales to get a bettr view of their surroundings.</p>
            
            <p>Despite their immense size, blue whales are graceful swimmers, capable of reachng speeds of up to 30 miles per hour (48 kilometers per hour) in short bursts. They use their powerful tails to propel themselves through the water, often traveling long distances during migration or in search of food.</p><br><br>

        <section id="diet">
            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>Blue whales are the big animals on Earth, and their immense size is supported by a diet consist  mainly of tiny creatures called as krill. These small, shrimp-like creatures are abundant in the world's oceans and acts as the priary food source for blue whales.</p>
            
            <p>Blue whales are filter feeders, using baleen plates in their mouths to strain vast quantities of water and extract krill. During feeding, a blue whale will open its mouth wide and take large volumes of water, along with the kill contained within. As the whale closes its mouth, it makes the water out through its  plates, trapping the krill inside for consumption.</p>
            
            <p>A single adult blue whale can consume up to 4 tons of krill per day during feeding season, making them one of the most efficient predators in the ocean. Blue whales have been known to undertake long-distance migrations in search of krill-rich waters, following seasonal patterns of krill abundance and distribution.</p>
            
            <p>The diet of blue whales is closely linked to the health and abundance of krill populaions, which in turn depend on factors such as ocean temperature, currents, and nutrient availability. Chanes in the marine environment, inclding climate change and human activities, can impact krill populations and ultimately affect the feeding behavior and survival of blue whales.</p>

        <section id="reproduction">
            <h2>Reproduction</h2>
            <p>Blue whales reproduceing via sexual reproduction, with mating usually occured during the winter months. Males compete for females, often engaging in aggressive behavior such as ramming and tail-slapping to establish dominance. Once a male successfully mates with a female, the gestation period lasts approximately 10 to 12 months.</p>
            
            <p>Female blue whales typically give birth to a single calf, which is born with tail to reduce the risk of drowning. Newborn calves are already large at birth, measuring around 23 feet (7 meters) in length and weighing up to 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilograms). Mother and calf form a close bond, with the mother providing milk to nourish the calf for about 6 to 8 months.</p>
            
            <p>Blue whale calves grow rapidly, gaining up to 200 pounds (90 kilograms) per day from their mother's rich milk. During this time, the mother teaches the calf essential survival skills, including swimming, diving, and feeding techniques. Once teaching, the calf becomes independent and begins its journey as a solitary individual in the vast ocean.</p>
